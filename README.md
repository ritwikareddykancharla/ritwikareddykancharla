## 👩‍🔬 Applied Scientist • Mechanistic Interpretability • Model Visualization

I love visualizing how neural networks **think**, **learn**, and **develop structure**.

Here are some examples of the visuals I create 👇

## 🚚 What I'm Working On — **RoutingAGI**

I'm building **RoutingAGI**, a spatial-transformer + SSM architecture designed for  
*Amazon-scale routing, spatial reasoning, and interpretable decision-making.*

RoutingAGI explores:

- 🗺️ Graph-based spatial encoding  
- 🌀 SSM/Mamba-style route planning  
- 🧩 Constraint-aware MoE (capacity, SLAs, time windows)  
- 📦 Multi-agent route generation  
- 🔍 Full mechanistic transparency (attention circuits, activations, geometry)

A routing model that not only performs…  
but **explains itself**.

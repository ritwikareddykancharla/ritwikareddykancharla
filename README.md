# Hi, I’m Ritwika — Applied ML Systems & Competition Tracker ♟️🧠
<img src="assets/lottie/cat_big.gif" width="200px" align="right"/>

👩‍🔬 I build **end-to-end applied ML systems** for research challenges and competitive
benchmarks, where models must reason reliably under **strict inference and evaluation
constraints**.

My work focuses on turning complex problem settings into **controlled, reproducible
pipelines** — emphasizing legality, verification, and performance over unconstrained
model behavior.

These projects prioritize:
- structured reasoning  
- verifiable decision-making  
- evaluation-driven iteration  
- systems that hold up under real constraints

### ♟️ [global-chess-challenge-2025](https://github.com/ritwikareddykancharla/global-chess-challenge-2025)  
**Text-only chess reasoning under strict inference constraints**

A language-model–based chess agent that must select **exactly one legal move** and
produce a **one-sentence natural language rationale**, without access to search,
external tools, or chess engines at inference time.

- Input: FEN position, side to move, legal moves (UCI)
- Output: UCI move + short explanation
- Evaluation via **Average Centipawn Loss (ACPL)** and Swiss-style tournament play
- Focus on structured reasoning, legality, and consistency

Status: **Active**
